                    <h4>About...</h4>
                    <p>I'm an aspiring web developer with a background in Financial Intelligence and Compliance. 
                        I have worked for large finacial institutions such as JP Morgan, Bank of America, 
                        and Rabobank NA; mainly focusing on anti-money laundering and terrorist financing. <br />
                        <br /> Although I am self-taught; I have been assisted by numerous mentors who have aided
                        my progress along the way. I have learned HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I have also learned
                        the Angular web framework. I am primarily seeking employment as a full-stack developer, 
                        but am open to other exciting opportunities within the industry which will afford me 
                        experience and the ability to further develop my skills. </p>
